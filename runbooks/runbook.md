## Host Platform

AWS

## Architecture

The Content Preview service serves published and unpublished content from Methode CMS so that journalists can preview unpublished articles in the context that closely matches the live publication on the Next FT platform. 
It is one of internal services that comprise UPP read stack and is not meant to be accessible publicly but to collaborate with other services such as `content-public-read-preview`, which in turn gives access to an authenticated public API to read preview content. 
Content Preview relies on Methode API service and Methode Article Transformer service; both underlying services are crucial to serve preview content.
