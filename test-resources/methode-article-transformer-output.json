It called for a “public benefit exemption” that would apply to utilities. </p>\n<p>The Treasury is “very mindful” of the impact of its proposals on different sectors and “the need to be particularly careful about infrastructure”, a senior official said this month.</p>\n<p>Since privatisation of the water industry in 1989, the companies — now mostly owned by private equity investors — have taken on tens of billions of pounds of debt, sometimes in the form of loans from shareholders.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, the regulator, described water companies’ use of shareholder loans paying high interest rates to reduce tax as “\n<content id=\"f3f20fe4-d1d8-11e2-9336-00144feab7de\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">morally questionable in a vital public service</content>”.  </p>\n<p>The companies challenge charges that they avoid tax. Water UK said: “The UK water industry, being heavily regulated and capital intensive, presents an exceptionally low risk [of tax avoidance].” </p>\n<p>Anglian Water said: “Between 2015 and 2020, water companies will invest £44bn, and debt funding is the most efficient and cheapest way of achieving these huge sums while keeping customer bills low. To encourage this investment, tax relief is available on interest payments.”</p>\n<p>The water industry, it added, was “not comparable with multinationals that shift profits to avoid paying tax in the UK”. </p>\n<p>Thames Water said it used a combination of debt and equity to fund its investment programme and that restricting the tax deductibility of interest costs “could place upward pressure on revenues and therefore customer bills”.</p>\n<p>Between 2010 and 2015 water companies paid £710m less corporate tax than the regulator expected, as a result of cuts to the corporate tax rate and transfer of losses from other group companies, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The-economic-regulation-of-the-water-sector.pdf\">National Audit Office.</a> </p>\n<p>They also benefited from low borrowing costs and high inflation and passed on some of the benefit to consumers, but this was “far below the total level of windfall gains”. </p>\n</body>","description":null,"mediaType":null,"pixelWidth":null,"pixelHeight":null,"internalBinaryUrl":null,"externalBinaryUrl":null,"members":null,"mainImage":"db125bec-9a75-11e5-0c4e-107cd9a0d095","comments":{"enabled":true},"publishReference":"tid_ZgFxRopapT","lastModified":null}
